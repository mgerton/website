# My Website

This is the repository for [mattgerton.com](http://mattgerton.com). This version of the site is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Running Locally

If for some strange reason you want to pull down my site and run it locally, make sure you first have NodeJS installed (see exact version in `.nvmrc`) and preferably Yarn. Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then run `gatsby develop` to start a local live-reload server.
